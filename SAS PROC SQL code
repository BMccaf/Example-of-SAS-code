### I wrote this SAS code for a specific project in the KDHE's Bureau of Epidemiology and Public Health Informatics. 
It queries a database to find the number of births in the Wichita area ###

proc sql;
create table count_by_zip as select
     zip,
      count(optical_key_num) as num_births
from VSHIST.ORIGBRHS2021
where state in ('KANSAS','KS')
and county eq 'SEDGWICK'
and substr(idob,7,4) eq '2021'
and substr(zip,1,5) in("67001","67016")
GROUP BY zip
ORDER BY count(optical_key_num) DESC;
Quit;
